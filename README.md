## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- 2GB+ free disk space for voice models

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/Tecknomancer/super-agent-interface.git)
   cd llm-voice-interface
   ```

2. **Install dependencies and download models**
   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```
   This will install all required dependencies and download the voice models needed for speech recognition and synthesis.

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Then edit the `.env` file to add your API keys for OpenAI and/or Anthropic.

4. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to start using the interface.

## 📝 Usage Guide

### Voice Interaction

1. Click the microphone button to start voice recording
2. Speak clearly into your microphone
3. Recording will automatically stop after you finish speaking
4. The system will process your speech, send it to the LLM, and respond both in text and voice

### Text Interaction

1. Type your message in the input field
2. Press Enter or click the send button
3. The system will process your message and respond in text (and voice if enabled)

### Code Display

- Code snippets detected in the LLM response will automatically appear in the code window
- Use the "Copy" button to copy code to your clipboard
- The language is automatically detected and syntax highlighting applied

### Customizing Voice

1. Use the voice selector dropdown to choose your preferred voice
2. Toggle voice output on/off using the speaker button
3. Voice settings are remembered between sessions

### Managing API Keys

1. Click the "API Keys" button to open the management modal
2. Add new API keys with a name, provider type, and the key itself
3. Select and use any stored API key
4. Delete keys you no longer need

## 🔊 Voice Features

### Available Voices

The system includes multiple voice options:

- Male (US English)
- Female (US English)
- British English
- Australian English
- Indian English
- Spanish

### Offline Processing

Both speech recognition and text-to-speech are processed locally, providing:

- Enhanced privacy (no audio data sent to external services)
- Lower latency for voice interactions
- No usage limits or API costs
- Ability to function without internet connectivity

## 🧩 API Integration

### Supported LLM Providers

- **OpenAI**: GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo
- **Anthropic**: Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3 Sonnet

### Adding New LLM Providers

To add support for additional LLM providers:

1. Extend the `llmService.js` file with appropriate API calls
2. Add the new provider to the model selector in `index.html`
3. Implement the necessary authentication in `apiKeyManager.js`

## 🔒 Security Notes

- API keys are stored in browser localStorage with basic encoding
- For production use, consider implementing a more secure key management system
- The project is designed for personal/local use by default

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Voice Recognition Issues

- Ensure your microphone is properly connected and has necessary permissions
- Check that the DeepSpeech models were downloaded correctly
- Consider using a USB microphone for better quality in noisy environments

### Voice Synthesis Issues

- Verify that Piper was installed correctly during setup
- Check console for any errors related to voice synthesis
- Ensure the selected voice model exists in the models directory

### Connection Issues

- Verify that the server is running on the expected port
- Check for any CORS issues if accessing from a different domain
- Ensure WebSocket connections are not blocked by firewalls

## 📚 Development

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the server with hot reloading enabled.

### Adding Custom Voice Models

Custom voice models compatible with Piper can be added to the `server/services/voice/models` directory. After adding, update the `VOICE_MODELS` object in `piperService.js`.

## 📱 Mobile Support

The interface is fully responsive and works on mobile devices with the following considerations:

- The panels stack vertically on small screens
- Microphone access requires HTTPS on most mobile browsers
- Performance may vary depending on the device's capabilities
